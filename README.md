Treaps and Randomized Binary Trees
=====

Pedagogic treap and randomized binary tree implementations in Java. The provided main method
creates treaps, randomized binary search trees, and binary search trees on the same data,
and compares their heights and branching statistics (how many children the nodes have on average)
to get an estimate of their shapes.
